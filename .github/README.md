[TaskoMask](https://github.com/hamed-shirbandi/TaskoMask/wiki/User-Guide-Documentation) is an open-source task management system built on the .Net framework. The primary objective of this project is to demonstrate the practical application of advanced software development concepts such as DDD (Domain-Driven Design), TDD (Test-Driven Development), BDD (Behavior-Driven Development), and Microservices.

In many cases, the experience of applying these concepts to real-world software products is often obscured by proprietary software companies. TaskoMask seeks to provide transparency and insight into their usage.

We invite you to explore our project's [wiki](https://github.com/hamed-shirbandi/TaskoMask/wiki) for more information
